# Readline

Provides readline/emacs-ish bindings for text boxes in Minecraft.

Available mappings:

```
C-a = beginning-of-line
C-e = end-of-line

C-b = backward-char
C-f = forward-char

M-b = backward-word
M-f = forward-word

C-h = backward-delete-char
C-w = backward-delete-word
C-u = backward-delete-line
C-k = forward-delete-line

C-t = transpose-chars
M-t = transpose-chars

M-c = capitalize-word
M-u = upcase-word
M-l = downcase-word
```

You'll be able to change these one day.
